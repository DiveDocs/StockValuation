# StockValuation

Added first efforts to extract fundamental data. 
Currently: I scan through the revenue data (which seems to be 4 years for Yahoo finance), and then calculate revenue growth for 3 of those 4 years.
Questions: What about decreasing revenue, then we would need to do a different calculation

ToDo: 
  Earnings data
  Debt vs. Cash 
  Debt vs. 1 Yr CashFlow
  Insider Holdings
  and more.
